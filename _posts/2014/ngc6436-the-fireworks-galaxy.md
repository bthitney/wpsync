NGC6436, The Fireworks Galaxy, is about 20 million light years away in Cepheus (I've read conflicting information that it is as close as 10 million light years and as far away as 22 million light years).  It's roughly 1/3 the size of our Milky Way.  The galaxy itself is incredibly active with star formation and frequent supernovae.

This image consists of 40 360s exposures with a Canon T4i and Edge 11" SCT at f/10, with 10 600s 12nm Ha frames (also with DSLR) added to the red channel.

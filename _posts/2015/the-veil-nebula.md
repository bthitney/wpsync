The Veil Nebula (Narrowband).  The Eastern Veil (top) in its entirety, and about half of the Western Veil on bottom.  Captured with a Tak FSQ 106 and QSI683 with Astrodon 3nm filters.  15x900sec Ha, 15x900sec OIII, 10x900sec SII.

HubbleSite.org recently published a fascinating article on the Veil, including some great Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images.  Here's an <a href="http://hubblesite.org/pubinfo/pdf/2015/29/pdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excerpt from the article</a>:
<blockquote>The Cygnus Loop, or Veil Nebula as it is sometimes called, is the expanding remains of a massive star (about 20 times the mass of the sun) that exploded some 5,000 – 10,000 years ago in our Milky Way galaxy.  Its distance is still a matter of debate, but is roughly 2,100 lightQyears.  Over 3 degrees across (six times the angular size of the moon), its physical diameter is some 110 lightQyears.  (Note: At this scale, the WFC3 image is just about 2 lightQyears across.)</blockquote>

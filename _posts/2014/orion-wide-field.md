Orion is one of most well known constellations and one of the easiest to recognize in the winter sky.  M42, the Orion Nebula, is also one of the brightest and easiest to see with the unaided eye, making up part of the Sword of Orion.  In this image, the three stars of Orion's belt can be see on the right side, with the Horsehead and Flame nebula close to Alnitak, the left-most star in the belt.

This image consists of only 10 180s exposures, with a Canon T4i and 200mm lens, stopped down to f/4.  The camera has been modified to accept more Ha light than stock; otherwise, the Horsehead area would not likely be visible.

Located in Cygnus, the North America Nebula is an emission nebula located near Deneb, the tail of the Swan.Â  It's a large nebula, getting its name from its resemblance to North America; although this image is somewhat wide-field, an even larger wide-field shot shows the sheer volume of nebulae and stars in the area, including the Pelican Nebula which is part of the same interstellar gas cloud.

This image was taken with a Canon T4i and Edge 11" SCT with Hyperstar lens (f/2), consisting of 60 exposures in equal parts of 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 seconds.

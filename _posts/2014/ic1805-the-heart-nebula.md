Located in Cassiopeia at about 7,500 light years away and 200 light years wide, the Heart Nebula gets its name from its heart-shaped appearance.  The nebula makes a terrific narrowband target, though this image is in more natural visible spectrum where the heart shows its red glow characteristic of an emission nebula.  The brightest part is NGC896, at the left of image (see annotated version below).

This image consists of 40 90s and 40 120s exposures using a Canon T4i and Hyperstar Lens on an Edge 11" SCT (f/2).

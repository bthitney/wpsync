The Bubble Nebula, NGC7635 and Sh2-162, is an emission nebula in Cassiopeia.  It's near the cluster M52 (I'm working on a wide-field image now that has both the Bubble and M52).  The bubble itself (about 10 light years across) is formed and pushed out by a massive star in the middle of the bubble -- its stellar wind irradiating the gas and causing it to glow.

The image is a combination of 30 360s exposures with a Canon T4i (modified to allow Ha light) and Edge 11" SCT at f/10.  Taken from a dark site in southeastern Utah.

M78 is a gorgeous reflection nebula near Orion. Barnard's Loop, towards the right, forms a huge (relatively speaking) emission nebula ring around Orion's belt and the Orion Nebula.Â  Captured with a QSI683 and Tak FSQ 106, this image contains about 12 ea of RGB at 600s, 6 hours total integration.

While the galaxies would be easy to miss unless annotated, it's amazing to think about those faint galaxies (PGC catalog) and what might lie inside them:

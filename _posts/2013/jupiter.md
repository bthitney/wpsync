A quick shot of Jupiter, taken with a 11" Edge SCT and Powermate 4x and TIS DBK 21AU618.AS color camera and stacked with Registax.  While the conditions were briefly pristine for this unusually clear shot from my home, I had the debayering misconfigured -- so, no color data was recorded.  This is often desirable when using a monochrome camera because of the enhanced detail it records, but serves no purpose for color cameras as desaturation of the image can accomplish the same affect

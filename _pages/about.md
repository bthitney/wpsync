Thanks for stopping by!  On this site, you'll find a collection of astrophotography and related content. I'm an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer; since 2013, I've gotten more serious about taking better pictures and have built this site to tell that story.

I reside in North Carolina with my wife and two daughters.  During the day, I work for Microsoft as a technical evangelist helping customers build solutions on Microsoft's Cloud platform, Azure.

While acquiring better equipment over time has certainly helped, creating a good image (in my opinion, anyway) requires several things to come together: capable equipment, good conditions (sky), time, and processing skills. I'll save the details on equipment choice for blog posts, but equipment and processing skills are always evolving.

With each image, I've learned something -- perhaps longer exposures, more exposures, or different framing would've made the image better.  I'll revisit targets when I have something new to try.
